- #### As a team you can use category like food and then make charity event in this category and every team could use what ever he wants on categories.
- #### At the end of the contest there will be referee that will give every team points depened on the event they make.
### My task that i make a software (mobile application):
- #### Help team members to upload there videos and images that show what they did in there event.
- #### Every team could choose the category he wants and make an event on this category from app.
- #### Referee  could login with app and evaluated every event.
- #### We handle notifications that will send to referees or teams in the app.
- #### We divided the categories among the referees, so that each referee evaluates a specific category assigned to him.
- #### We handle that every team could handle his profile from the app by adding photo, give name, team leader and team members.
